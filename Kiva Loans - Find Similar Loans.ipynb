    "# Calculate Similarity\n",
    "Given the diverse set of features here (about location, borrower, and the loan itself) let's just start with a really simple similarity metric.  We'll use Jaccard similarity, where each element of a user's set of loans will just get included in a set of loan elements.  Then we'll find a loan that's currently eligible with a large number of overlapping elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could eventually measure similarity across different metrics and weight more important ones more heavily, but to start let's just throw everything in the same set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this is that if someone consistently prefers the same country (for example) that's only indirectly accounted for in the small size of the set of elements (because that country would be counted only once, though it occurred many times.)  However, this will work as a proof of concept."
